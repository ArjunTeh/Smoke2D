* TODO 
  Particles are getting stuck together - decide whether or not the pressure should be negative or positive

* Notes about the simulation
  per grid, there should generally be only one particle per grid at the rest state
  they should be pushing away from each other, so why do they clump?

** Clustering
   Clumping is a common bug that most people have, that has to do with the choice of kernel, the piecewise function should deal with it
   Clustering is also solved by having two kernel functions that are used, with one being the near case?

** Data structure
   Currently the hash being used right now doesn't correctly index the grid space to get the correct spaces

** Adding energy  
   Right now, for some reason, energy is being added into the system per collision?
   Perhaps that has to do with the pressure equation?
   recalculating mass probably needs to happen as well
